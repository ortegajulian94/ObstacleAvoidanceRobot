# Obstacle Avoidance Project

Welcome to the obstacle avoidance project! This project focuses on developing an obstacle detection and avoidance system for a robotic platform using Python, AI, ML, and robotics techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a system that allows a robotic platform to autonomously navigate through an environment while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path. The system consists of several components, including:

- **Obstacle Detection:** Uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect obstacles in the environment using sensor data such as camera images.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implements algorithms and strategies to navigate around detected obstacles safely.
- **Integration with Robot Control:** Integrates obstacle detection and avoidance logic with the robot's control system to enable autonomous navigation.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection:** Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect obstacles in camera images.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implements logic to navigate around detected obstacles using strategies such as stopping, turning, or changing direction.
- **Integration with Robot Control:** Interfaces with the robot's control system to execute navigation commands based on obstacle detection results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the obstacle avoidance project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Train the obstacle detection model using the provided training data and scripts in the `src/model_training.py` module.
4. Implement the obstacle detection and avoidance logic in the `src/obstacle_detection.py` and `src/obstacle_avoidance.py` modules, respectively.
5. Test the system in a simulated environment to verify its performance and functionality.

## Usage

To use the obstacle avoidance system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the necessary hardware components (e.g., cameras, sensors) are connected and configured correctly.
2. Run the main script or application that integrates the obstacle detection and avoidance logic with the robot's control system.
3. Monitor the system's behavior and performance in navigating through the environment and avoiding obstacles.
4. Make adjustments and improvements to the system as needed based on testing and evaluation results.
